When winter comes for war,
You shall hear no Lions roar.
When winter forces you to yield,
No Stags shall graze upon the field.
When winter creeps upon you from the shadows,
No Roses shall bloom from the meadows.
When winter wreaks havoc on the land,
You can bet there'll be no Snakes in the sand.
When winter brings to life all it finds grim,
The Krakens will freeze where they swim.
When winter sets and the land begins to shiver,
The Flayed Man will start to rot and wither.
When winter fights to the last sliver,
No more Trouts shall swim in the river.
When winter ravages and all despair,
No Falcons shall fly high in the air.
When winter shows you what happens when snow falls,
Not even Dragons Breath shall warm you in your halls.
When winter comes with all it's might,
Only the Wolves shall howl in the night.
